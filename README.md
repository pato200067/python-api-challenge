# python-api-challenge
In this challeenge, our knowledge in regards to Python requests,APIs, and JSON traversals was brought to play to answer fundamental questions.
A dataset called cities was used in the analysis. City data contains 9 variables namely city, latitude, longitude, max temperature, humodity, cloudiness, wind speed, country, and date. The data set contains 577 observations.
Two types kinds of analysis were carried out, one WeatherPy.ipynb file and the other in VacationPy.ipynb file. The citypy library was used to generate a list of cities. The total number of cities in the list was genetaed. Lat and LOng combination were used to locate nearest cities.
Various scatter plots were constructed to show relationship between weather variables.Some of the findings from weather variable relationship are,
The graph shows that temperature tends to drop as you move away from the equator
Regression line equation is: y = -0.51x + 33.71
The r-squared is: -0.8462548186825364
The regression displays a negative correlation.
In the nothern hemisphere, as you move away from the equator the temperature decreases.
Regression line equation is: y = 0.33x + 28.8
The r-squared is: 0.6419546065421801
The regression displays a positive correlation.
In the southern hemisphere, as you get closer to the equator the temperature increases.
Regression line equation is: y = 0.26x + 61.28
The r-squared is: 0.2385317912939407
The regression does not display much of a correlation between the data sets.
Regression line equation is: y = 0.03x + 70.73
The r-squared is: 0.016759316950056818
The regression does not display much of a correlation between the data sets.
